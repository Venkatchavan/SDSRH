# SDSRH
A project based on file structures concept in C++ language which is  designed to get the input from the user to a text file and CRUD  operations are performed on the same. 


This C++ program is designed to manage COVID-19 patient records and vaccination appointments efficiently. It offers features for adding, searching, and displaying patient records, as well as booking vaccination slots and viewing vaccination statistics.

## Features

### COVID-19 Patient Records

- Add patient details including BU number, name, age, phone number, and hospital.
- Search for patients by BU number or name (secondary key).
- Remove patient records.
- Display patient records.
- Secondary key index for efficient searching.
- Data files for patient records and index storage.

### Vaccination Management

- Record vaccination appointments with Aadaar number, name, age, gender, phone, and address.
- View and search vaccination records.
- Book vaccination slots with start and end times.
- Sort vaccination slots.
- Display vaccination statistics, including the number of vaccinated people and available slots.

## Usage

### COVID-19 Patient Records

1. **Add Patient Record:** Enter patient details, including BU number, name, age, phone number, and hospital. The system will store the data and update the index files.

2. **Search Patients:** Search for patients by BU number or name (secondary key). The system displays matching records.

3. **Remove Patient Records:** Delete patient records by specifying the BU number.

4. **Display Patients:** View the details of all patients in the system.

### Vaccination Management

1. **Add Vaccination Record:** Record vaccination appointments by entering Aadaar number, name, age, gender, phone number, and address. The system will store the data and update the index files.

2. **View Vaccination Records:** Display vaccination records, including Aadaar number, name, age, gender, phone number, and address.

3. **Search Vaccination Records:** Search for vaccination records by name (secondary key) and display matching records.

4. **Book Vaccination Slots:** Book available vaccination slots with specified start and end times.

5. **Sort Vaccination Slots:** Sort the vaccination slots based on start times.

6. **View Vaccination Statistics:** Check the number of people vaccinated and the available slots.

*3.Requirement Analysis*

a)Add Patient Record:The system must provide a form to input and store patient details, including BU number, name, age, phone number, and hospital.

b)Search Patients:Users should be able to search for patients based on BU number or name.

c)Remove Patient Record:Authorized users should have the ability to remove patient records by specifying the BU number.

d)Display Patients:Users should be able to view a list of all patients in the system.

e)Add Vaccination Record:The system must support the addition of vaccination records with details such as Aadhaar number, name, age, gender, phone number, and address.

f) View Vaccination Records:Users should be able to view a list of all vaccination records in the system.

g)Search Vaccination Records: Users should have the ability to search for vaccination records by name.

h)Book Vaccination Slots:The system must allow users to book available vaccination slots with specified start and end times.

i)Sort Vaccination Slots:Users should be able to sort vaccination slots based on start times.

j)View Vaccination Statistics:Users should be able to check the number of vaccinated people and available slots.
