### Prerequisites:

1. **C++ Compiler:**
   Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Common ones include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for Unix-like systems or MinGW for Windows.

### Steps to Build and Run:

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.

2. **Navigate to Code Directory:**
   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your C++ code files are located.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/code
   ```

3. **Compile the Code:**
   Use the appropriate compiler command to compile the C++ files. For example, if you are using GCC:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o my_program
   ```

   This command compiles `main.cpp` and creates an executable named `my_program`. Replace `main.cpp` with your main code file.

4. **Run the Executable:**
   Execute the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./my_program
   ```

   If you are using Windows with MinGW, the command might be:

   ```bash
   my_program.exe
   ```

   Ensure that you replace `my_program` with the actual name you used during compilation.

5. **Follow the Program's Prompts:**
   The program seems to be menu-driven, so follow the prompts and input relevant information based on the menu options provided.
